## Flavors

In OpenStack, flavors define the compute, memory, and storage capacity of nova 
computing instances. To put it simply, a flavor is an available hardware 
configuration for a server. It defines the size of a virtual server that can be 
launched.

A flavor consists of a list of parameters including Name, vCPUs, RAM, etc. Check
[here](https://docs.openstack.org/nova/latest/user/flavors.html) for a full 
list of the available specs.
