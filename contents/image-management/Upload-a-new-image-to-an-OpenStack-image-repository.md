## Upload a new image to an OpenStack image repository

You can upload images through the `openstack image create` command or the 
Image service API:

  * [GUI](https://docs.openstack.org/horizon/latest/user/manage-images.html#upload-an-image)
  * [CLI](https://docs.openstack.org/python-openstackclient/latest/cli/command-objects/image-v2.html#image-create)

After you upload an image, you cannot change it.
