## Manage images

Depending on the role a users are assigned in Openstack, they may have 
permission to upload and manage virtual machine images. Operators might 
restrict the upload and management of images to cloud administrators or 
operators only. If the appropriate privileges are given, either the dashboard, 
or the `openstack` and `glance` command-line tools can be used to manage images.
